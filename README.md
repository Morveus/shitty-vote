# shitty-vote

A shitty voting system without any database nor user accounts

# Setup
- Create a "/votes" folder (or update the corresponding variable)
- Change the contents of "menu.json" with whatever you wish it to contain
- Change "title.txt" to whatever you want your title to be

# Use it
Run a PHP server, point your friends and family to its URL and click the "Vote" buttons.

People can only vote once per session, which is good enough for a family and/or friends usage
